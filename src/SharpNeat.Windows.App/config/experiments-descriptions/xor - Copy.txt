Logical exclusive-OR (XOR).

The goal is to reproduce the following logic truth table:

  In1 | In2 | Out
  -----------------
  0   | 0   | 0
  0   | 1   | 1
  1   | 0   | 1
  1   | 1   | 0

Each test case is tested in turn.

An output less than 0.5 is interpreted as a 0 (false) response, >= 0.5 is interpreted as a 1 (true) response.

Fitness allocation per test case is on a continuous linear scale in the interval [0,1]; these are summed for all four test cases.
An additional fitness of 10 is added to the total if all four test cases are passed, giving a maximum possible fitness of 14.
